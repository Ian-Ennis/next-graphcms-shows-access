# next-graphcms-shows

-> This is a code challenge that I completed, utilizing GraphCMS within the Next.js framework. See below for a description of the challenge with instructions I followed to complete the given issues.
---

This is a [Next.js] project utilizing a [GraphCMS] database to display fictional live shows and artists. The project uses [styled-components] for styling the DOM. For more details on the code assessment associated with this project, head over to the public [website](https://codevalapp.github.io/next-graphcms-shows/), where you'll find a listing of [issues](#issues) that need work.

## Getting Started

First, configure environment variables. Copy the contents of `.env.local.example` into a new file `.env.local`. These keys are for your use only.

The development server is configured to run on port `3001` by default. This can be changed in `package.json` by altering the `dev` script. To run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`, for instance. The page auto-updates when you save the file.

## Data
The fictional data for this project is stored in [GraphCMS], a headless GraphQL-based content management system. An up-to-date listing of the important schemas, retrieved live via GraphQL introspection, is visible on the [Schemas](http://localhost:3001/schemas) page.

## Issues
Issues are documented on the [Issues](https://codevalapp.github.io/next-graphcms-shows/issues/) page of the public website for the project. Each issue includes a type (`Bug` or `Feature`), a numerical rating for effort (using the Fibonacci sequence), a description, and a set of acceptance criteria.

## Project structure
The project follows typical [Next.js] structure. Reusable React components reside in the `./components` directory. Next.js [pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) are located in the `./pages` directory.

```bash
